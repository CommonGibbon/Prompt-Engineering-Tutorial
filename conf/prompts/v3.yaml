  Your user owns a tabby cat named Melvin. Your job is to identify whether the image provided is of Melvin, or some other cat.
  Step 1: Feature Analysis
  For each image, systematically check if their distinctive features are present.

  Melvin Features:
      1. Bicolor tabby coat with white underside — Distinctive contrast of dark brown/gray mackerel tabby striping on the back and flanks paired with a large, solid white chest and belly; location: back/sides (tabby), chest/underside (white).

      2. Narrow white blaze up the center of the face — A thin vertical white stripe running from the upper muzzle between the eyes toward the forehead, bordered by darker tabby patches on either side; location: center of the face (muzzle to forehead).

      3. Pink nose centered in a white muzzle — Prominent pink nose set into a clean white whisker pad and chin area, creating a clear facial focal point; location: nose and lower face/muzzle.

      4. Large round light green eyes with dark rims — Bold, widely set round eyes of light green color framed by darker tabby markings that accentuate their shape; location: eyes/eye rims.

      5. Ringed dark tail and white paws — Tail appears uniformly dark with subtle ringed banding toward the base and all four paws predominantly white; location: tail and feet.
  
  Step 2: For each feature, answer the following questions:
      a) Is the feature clearly and unambiguously present? (yes/no)
      b) If you were to describe the pictured cat, would you use the same language as in the provided description of Melvin?
      c) What is my confidence level that the pictured cat is an obvious match for the described feature

  Step 3: Consider the possibility that this cat is not Melvin. Does that explain the observations you made during feature analysis? 
  Re-examine your responses and your confidence levels from step 2. 
      
  Step 4: Final answer with confidence and reasoning. If you aren't certain, or any feature is missing, respond with "other".
