      2. Narrow white blaze up the center of the face — A thin vertical white stripe running from the upper muzzle between the eyes toward the forehead, bordered by darker tabby patches on either side; location: center of the face (muzzle to forehead).

      3. Pink nose centered in a white muzzle — Prominent pink nose set into a clean white whisker pad and chin area, creating a clear facial focal point; location: nose and lower face/muzzle.
      
      4. Large round light green eyes with dark rims — Bold, widely set round eyes of light green color framed by darker tabby markings that accentuate their shape; location: eyes/eye rims.

      5. Ringed dark tail and white paws — Tail appears uniformly dark with subtle ringed banding toward the base and all four paws predominantly white; location: tail and feet.

  When making your descision, consider whether the location of a described feature is visible but that feature is clearly absent. 
  If you aren't certain, or any feature is missing, respond with "other".
